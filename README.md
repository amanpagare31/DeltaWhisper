## Usage

After installation, you can run DeltaWhisper with the following command:
```bash
go run main.go
```

### Configuration

Before running the bot, configure the settings in the `config.json` file. This file includes:

- API keys for exchanges
- Trading pairs
- Arbitrage thresholds

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "exchanges": {
    "exchange1": {
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"
    },
    "exchange2": {
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"
    }
  },
  "trading_pairs": ["BTC/USD", "ETH/USD"],
  "arbitrage_threshold": 0.02
}
```

## How It Works

DeltaWhisper operates by following these steps:

1. **Connect to Exchanges**: The bot establishes connections to the specified exchanges using API keys.
2. **Fetch Market Data**: It retrieves current prices for the trading pairs you specified.
3. **Identify Arbitrage Opportunities**: DeltaWhisper compares prices across exchanges to find discrepancies.
4. **Execute Trades**: When an opportunity meets your criteria, the bot executes the trade automatically.

### Example Workflow

1. **Market Monitoring**: DeltaWhisper checks the price of BTC on Exchange A and Exchange B.
2. **Price Comparison**: If BTC is $50,000 on Exchange A and $50,500 on Exchange B, the bot identifies a $500 arbitrage opportunity.
3. **Trade Execution**: The bot buys BTC on Exchange A and sells it on Exchange B, capturing the profit.
